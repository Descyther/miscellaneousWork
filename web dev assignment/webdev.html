<section id="columnOne">
<h1 align="center">Web Development</h1>
<p>Introduces the modern context of web design and development, the core development technologies and standards and design methods that cater for different current platforms. The key theme of the unit is the efficient design and development of effective and robust websites for the range of popular platforms using the most modern technologies and techniques.
Topics include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduction to the client-server model, web standards, HTML5 semantic mark up, control of presentation via style sheets, interactivity via JavaScript on the client side and PHP on the server side</li>
		<li>The use of high-level tools for design and development</li>
		<li>DOM element selection and manipulation via script libraries such as jQuery</li>
		<li>The production of standards compliant HTML5 video. Students will create dynamic web pages with AMP systems and script on the server side using PHP with MySQL and perform a basic install of a Content Management System such as WordPress. The key theme for scripting will be the understanding and development of readable code that listens for and responds to browser and user events by manipulating DOM elements.</li>
		<li>Applications of standards and conventions: 
		software maintenance and developing a professional 
		approach to coding</li>
		<li>Constructs and features of a structured high level
		programming language: control constructs, operators, 
		procedural abstraction, simple I/O and use of libraries</li>
		<li>Data types â€“ primitive types: constants, variables,
		arrays and simple structured data</li>
		<li>Object orientated design and implementation: 
		inheritance and polymorphism</li>
		<li>Software support environment: use of an IDE
